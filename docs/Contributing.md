# Contributing

Contributions are welcome in any form. Here are some guidelines to make this easier for everyone.

## Discussion

Discussions can be started in two ways. Either through the "Discussions" tab on GitHub, or on the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/KwgcQd5scF) server. If you have any questions or ideas, these are a great way to help
improve OneTrainer.

## Issues

If you find any problems, or you want to suggest new features, please create an issue. Before creating an issue, please
check if one already exists for the same topic to avoid duplications.

## Pull Requests

Before creating a bigger pull request for a new feature, please consider joining the discord or creating a discussion. This can
avoid situations where multiple people work on the same change. It also helps in keeping the changes aligned with the
general project structure and vision. Please also take a look at the [project structure documentation](ProjectStructure.md).
For smaller changes or fixes, this is not needed.
